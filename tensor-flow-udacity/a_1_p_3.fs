Problem 3
Another check: we expect the data to be balanced across classes. Verify that.
Merge and prune the training data as needed. Depending on your computer setup, you might not be able to fit it all in memory, and you can tune train_size as needed. The labels will be stored into a separate array of integers 0 through 9.
Also create a validation dataset for hyperparameter tuning.
